Alt-Fire SMG1 for NPCs
=======================

Modified SMG1 code so Combine Elite Soldiers can use the alt-fire of the SMG1. It also contains modified npc_combine.cpp so it fixes some cosmetic bugs. All credits are from Valve Corporation for the code. I (Maestro FÃ©nix) only take credit on re-enabling and fixing the code.
